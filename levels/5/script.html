  <p>"Sweet!" you cry out as the camera lights all dim in unison.  It might have been a minor diversion, but at least something went right on this mission.</p>
  <p>The radio silence from your agents is nerve-racking, but you follow protocol and stick to your mission objectives.</p>
  <p>As you reach the end of the clearing, there's a long steep road leading up to the compound.  Moving on this without being seen will be impossible.</p>
  <p>You decide to wait and look for signs of activity at the compound before heading up.  After an hour, you've only seen the clouds move and decide to start the long walk ahead.</p>
  <p>Exhausted and making the final turn, your jaw drops. A large metal gate blocks the path and secures the compound.  Quickly you run up to investigate but the gate is locked and secured by a digital keyless entry.</p>
  <p>Fully exposed with nowhere to hide, you find the determination to gain access.</p>
