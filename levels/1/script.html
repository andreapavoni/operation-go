  <p>This is the moment you've been waiting for since you joined the agency fifteen years ago to help bring the notorious cyber criminal Epoch to justice.</p>
  <p>"Intelligence is reporting that Epoch is on a remote island in the Pacific.  You're on a plane at 0600, with a briefing on the flight.  I know you've been waiting for this, so don't let us down."</p>
