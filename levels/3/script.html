  <p>No sooner do finish your code when you feel a strong arm grab you.</p>
  <p>"Epoch is down there on that island, but we have intelligence that he'll be leaving tomorrow.  Stay low tonight and the island will be empty in the morning," says a gruff looking agent.</p>
  <p>"Find his computer, and download the data onto this USB.  A boat will signal for you tomorrow at 0100," he says confidently.</p>
  <p>No sooner does he finish his sentence when the cargo bay door drops down and a blast of frigid air runs through your hair.</p>
  <p>"Good luck," the agent says with a sarcastic smile.</p>
  <p>Before you can reply a firm shove to your back sends you hurdling out of the plane.</p>
  <p>You calmly steady yourself and dive towards the island.  Everything is on track as your parachute deploys at 2001 meters, just as planned.</p>
  <p>When you land, you notice that the other agents have all landed far north of your location.</p>
  <p>You calmly unpack your GPS to find out where you are, but it's denying you access.</p>

  <p>No sooner do finish your code when you feel a presence looking over your shoulder.</p>
  <p>"Epoch is down there on that island, but we have intelligence that he'll be leaving tomorrow.  Stay low tonight and the island will be empty in the morning," says a tough looking agent.</p>
  <p>"Find his computer, and download the data onto this USB.  A boat will signal for you tomorrow at 0100," he says, barely finishing before walking away.</p>
  <p>As you get up to ask him a question the cargo bay door drops down and a blast of frigid air runs into the place.</p>
  <p>Before you can brace yourself from the wind a firm shove to your back sends you hurdling into the sky.</p>
  <p>You franticly steady yourself and dive towards the island.  Luckily, your parachute deploys at 2001 meters, just as planned.</p>
  <p>When you land, you notice that the other agents have all landed far north of your location.</p>
  <p>You calmly unpack your GPS to find out where you are, but it's denying you access.</p>
